Question 1  
Create a Tkinter application using the concepts of object-oriented 
programming, such as multiple inheritance, multiple decorators, 
encapsulation, polymorphism, and method overriding, etc.  
Wherever you use these concepts in code, explain them using # (How they are 
linked to code).  
Examples:  
• Youtube Like Interface Applications. 
• Using single/multiple Open-Source AI models (smaller) to create a 
desktop application. Ex: An Image classification application, Language 
translation app, object detection app, facial recognition app, etc.  
(You just need to download the models and add their input points to the 
buttons in your tkinter application. Whatever the user enters into the 
application should go the AI model and give an output on the 
application.) 
Question 2  
Create a simple “side-scrolling” 2D game using Pygame. The game should 
allow the player to control a character with the ability to run, jump, shoot 
projectiles. The game should have enemies, collectibles, and 3 levels. It should 
also have a scoring system for health and lives.  
The game should include the following but not be limited to:  
• Player class (movements, speed, jump, health, lives) - Methods 
• Projectile Class (movements, speed, damage) – Methods 
• Enemy Class (……………….) – Methods 
• Collectible Class (health boost, extra life, etc.) 
• Level Design (3 Levels), Add boss enemy at the end.  
• A scoring system based on enemies defeated and collectibles
collected, as well as a health bar for players and enemies. 
• Implement a game over screen with the option to restart. 
Bonus: Create a dynamic camera that follows the players smoothly. 
You have three game ideas; select one and implement the above 
requirements. 
• A game with human-like characters (hero, enemy)  
• A game with an animal (Hero) and human characters (Enemy). 
• A tank-based game navigating through a battlefield to engage with 
enemy tanks.
